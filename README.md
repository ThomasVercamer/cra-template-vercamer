This is my personal CRA template, it is by no means complete and might not be up to date.
However, you are free to use it however you like!

### In this template

This template (will) contains tons of stuff! However, it might become a little harder to keep track of whatever is going on.
But no worries, here is a short list of what you can expect:

[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)](https://reactjs.org/)
This should kind of explain itself, no?

[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
We are working with typescript. Why? Because today it is the industry standard, it helps you detect coding errors and the code completion is awesome 😎.
Other than that, I just really wanted to learn TS together with React, and it's my project!

[![Styled Components](https://img.shields.io/badge/styled--components-DB7093?style=for-the-badge&logo=styled-components&logoColor=white)](https://styled-components.com/)
I just like styled components. It gives me a very flexible way of creating themes and dynamically assigning themes to
my elements. Is it better than other systems? Maybe! Feel free to swap it for anything you want.

[![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/redux-%23593d88.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redux&logoColor=white)](https://redux.js.org/)
It's no easy discussion to decide between React hooks and Redux. Mostly because Redux is regarded as overkill (a lot of the times).
Personally, I just like the way it works. And once it's been set up, it's actually very easy to use. Combined with the **option** to extend
it thoroughly, and this became a no-brainer to me! Oh by the way: I've also used [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) --> it's awesome!

[![React Router](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=for-the-badge&logo=react-router&logoColor=white)](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6)
No web application without navigation. The most famous and easy to use library is React Router.
I saw no reason to try anything else to be honest.
